# Fake_News_Detection_using_ML
This project aims to detect fake news using supervised machine learning models. We implemented and compared Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers using a labeled dataset of articles. The best model (SVM) achieved an accuracy of 93%. I want to give special thanks to Siddhardhan without whom this project wont be complete.
